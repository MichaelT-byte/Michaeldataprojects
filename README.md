Week 1 — Excel Foundations

Workbook: Data_Technician_Workbook_Michael_Thirlaway.docx

Focus: Core Excel skills, data ethics, and presentation of insights.

Key Skills:

Understanding and applying data protection laws (GDPR, Data Protection Act, FOI Act, Computer Misuse Act).

Data cleaning and organisation: converting datasets into Excel Tables, using sort and filter functions.

Core formulas:

SUM() for totals

AVERAGE() for averages

IFS() and SWITCH() for categorisation and conditional logic

Creating Pivot Tables to summarise data across regions, products, and demographics.

Visualisation with charts (line, bar, pie) to present retention and sales patterns.

Example Tasks:

Built a retail sales pivot table to analyse laptop, printer, and smartphone sales by county.

Used the SWITCH function to categorise sales volumes into High / Medium / Low brackets.

Applied the IFS function to classify car top speeds into “Very Fast / Fast / Moderate / Slow.”

Designed churn analysis visuals for a board presentation, showing customer drop-off at the 12-month renewal point.

Outcome:
By the end of Week 1, I demonstrated the ability to transform raw Excel datasets into actionable insights using formulas, pivot tables, and visuals — while ensuring compliance with data ethics and legislation.
