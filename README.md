### Week 1 — Excel Foundations

**Workbook:** `Data_Technician_Workbook_Michael_Thirlaway.docx`

This first week was all about getting comfortable with Excel and the basics of working with data. I started with some of the laws and regulations around handling data (GDPR, Data Protection Act, FOI, Computer Misuse Act), then moved into practical Excel work.

**What I worked on:**

* Turning raw datasets into tables so they’re easier to work with.
* Using formulas like `SUM()` and `AVERAGE()` for simple calculations, and `IFS()` / `SWITCH()` to classify data into categories.
* Building pivot tables to quickly summarise sales and customer data.
* Creating charts to highlight trends, such as customer drop-off at the 12-month renewal stage.

**Example:**
One exercise involved looking at product sales by county (laptops, printers, smartphones). I used a pivot table to break down totals and then applied the `SWITCH()` function to group sales into “High / Medium / Low” categories. In another task, I built visuals that showed customers were most likely to leave at the 12-month renewal point — something you’d definitely want to flag to a business.
